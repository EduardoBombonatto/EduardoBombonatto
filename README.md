# Eduardo Bombonatto

Hello! I am a **Software Engineer** with experience in building full-stack solutions, especially for enterprises, using technologies like **Java**, **Spring Boot**, **React**, and **PostgreSQL**. I am currently focused on developing and implementing systems that use **Artificial Intelligence** to solve complex problems, such as the platform that centralizes corporate data and the resume analyzer I am working on.

### üíº Selected Projects

#### **Enterprise Data Platform**

At FTSpar, I built a full-stack "oracle" platform that centralized fragmented company data into a single source of knowledge, increasing information retrieval efficiency by 62%. It enabled natural language queries to replace manual searches, cutting the average data lookup time by 30 minutes per request.

* **Key Achievements**:
    * Implemented Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with **LangChain** and **Ollama**, which improved productivity and reduced search latency.
    * Engineered and deployed a scalable architecture using **Spring Boot**, **PostgreSQL**, and **React**.
    * The system was containerized with **Docker** and deployed on **AWS**, supporting 230 concurrent users without downtime.
* **Stack**: Java, Spring Boot, React, JavaScript, Python, LangChain, Ollama, PostgreSQL, Docker, AWS.

#### **AI Resume Analyzer**

This is an ongoing project that analyzes and compares resumes with job descriptions, calculating a similarity percentage based on keyword matching and semantic relevance.

* **Features**:
    * It uses natural language processing and semantic search techniques with **LangChain** and **Python** to evaluate the alignment between resumes and job postings.
    * The back-end is built with **Spring Boot** and **FastAPI**, and the front-end with **React**.
    * The system is containerized with **Docker** and deployed to **AWS** for scalability and cloud accessibility.
